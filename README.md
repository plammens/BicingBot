# BicingBot - Telegram edition
This project brings to your phone the ultimate Telegram bot for travelling with Bicing in Barcelona.

 You can ask him many things, for example, it can show you the map of Barcelona with the geometric graph (whose nodes are the Bicing stations) with edges between the nodes that are closer than the certain distance you want.

 If you are impatient to know all its functionalities go directly to the [Features of Bicing](#Features-of-BicingBot) section. Nevertheless, it is highly recommended to read this document in order.
