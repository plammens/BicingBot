 - /start -- initialize a conversation with the bot
 
 - /help -- display this help message
 
 - `/graph <distance>` --  generate a geometric graph of the Bicing stations. Takes a single argument, `<distance>`, the maximum distance between two adjacent nodes, as a non-negative real number.
    
 - /status -- display information on the session's current status (i.e. last fetch time, current graph distance, etc.)
